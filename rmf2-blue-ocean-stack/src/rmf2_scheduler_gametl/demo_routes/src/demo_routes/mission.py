"""Multi-goal **mission** runner — drive one robot through an ordered list of
goal nodes (up to 3 from the RMF UI) through the full MAPF/VDA5050 stack.

Why a runner instead of one Schedule with N chained GoToNode ops: the
orchestrator's GoToNode completes (publishes TaskStatus) as soon as the planner
*dispatches* a leg's order to the VDA5050 master — NOT when the robot physically
arrives (see blue_ocean_planner_service.solve_batch). Chaining ops would fire
all legs at once. So sequencing must wait for *arrival*, which only something
with access to the master /state can do — hence this scheduler-side runner.

Each leg reuses the existing single-goal path (build_robot_schedule +
publish_schedules -> orchestrator -> MAPF -> VDA5050 order). Between legs the
runner polls the master /state until the robot reaches the leg's goal node.

**Rack pick/drop**: when a leg's goal is a rack node (see ``demo_routes.racks``)
an **AutoXing** robot jacks on arrival via the master's
``/actions/jack/{robot_id}/{direction}`` endpoint when ``goal_jacks`` supplies
an explicit direction ("up" = pick / "down" = drop). Reeman legs reach rack
nodes but skip jack. Use ``POST /demo/rack-direct`` for AutoXing pick/drop via
the robot REST API (no MAPF). After a rack leg the next leg starts from the
rack's **approach** node (e.g. ``3,5`` after pick/drop at ``2,5`` or ``3,4``),
not the rack node itself.
