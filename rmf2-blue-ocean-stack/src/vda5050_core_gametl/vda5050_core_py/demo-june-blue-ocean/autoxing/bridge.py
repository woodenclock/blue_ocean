"""Autoxing bridge imports — the robot REST/WebSocket I/O this adapter drives.

Importing the autoxing_bridge package runs its ``ensure_spellbook()``, which puts the
spellbook dir on ``sys.path`` — so ``jack_up`` / ``jack_down`` are importable
right after. A missing spellbook raises here (real-robot operation is the only
mode), which is the intended hard failure.
